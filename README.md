This application is an AI powered data assistant that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate SQL queries from natural language input. It allows users to analyze data from Google Sheets or Excel/CSV files without writing any SQL. The system processes user queries using LLMs (OpenAI ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or DeepSeek), runs SQL against the data, displays the results, and optionally visualizes them.
